<strong>Abstract:</strong> Can communication designed to increase
support for government policy and shift perceptions of state capacity
redress deep-rooted mistrust in state institutions? This paper finds
providing information on past state effectiveness, highlighting
citizens’ cooperation in enabling past effectiveness or appealing to
religious authorities’ support for government policy have limited impact
on support for policy, perceptions of state capacity and trust in the
state in Pakistan. This holds true on average and across important
dimensions of heterogeneity after comparing treatment effects to those
induced by an experimenter demand treatment. This paper highlights the
limits of using information to build trust in state institutions, and
the importance of measuring experimenter demand.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> We develop a groundwater extraction model
that considers the Marshallian inefficiency associated with
sharecropping and use data from Pakistan to simulate the impact of an
open access regime and of optimal management on groundwater extractions,
the state of the aquifer, and annual net benefits through time. We also
evaluate a price instrument as a mechanism of inducing optimal
extractions. Under both open access and optimal management, we observe
notable differences in groundwater extractions and the water table level
between the tenure model (which considers the behavior of both owner
cultivators and sharecroppers) and the baseline model (which includes
the behavior of only owner cultivators). We also find a modest
difference in the aggregate net benefits generated by the two models.
The results offer new insights—vis-à-vis land tenure heterogeneity—into
the evaluation of more effective policies for groundwater management and
aquifer sustainability.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we compare two brick kiln
technologies—the Bull’s Trench Kiln (BTK) and the Induced Draft Zigzag
Kiln (ZZK)—through a transdisciplinary approach by focusing on two
questions: do ZZKs tend to be cleaner than BTKs? Will operating ZZKs
generate any reasonable economic and social benefits? To answer the
first question, we collected and tested stack emission samples from two
kilns: a newly constructed ZZK in Punjab, Pakistan and a conventional
BTK located close to the ZZK. To address the second question, we
conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the two types of kiln technologies
using primary data on input and output quantities and prices from the
sample kilns. The environmental results show that the ZZK emitted
significantly less amount of harmful gases and particulate matter
compared to the BTK. The economic analysis demonstrates that ZZKs
improve both discounted private welfare and discounted social welfare
compared to BTKs. For policymakers, we also outline recommendations to
facilitate the technology transition to ZZKs. Our findings provide a
case for the adoption of ZZKs in developing countries and for
environmental policymakers to facilitate the technology transition.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Scarce information and human capital may make
it difficult to form accurate expectations, limiting responses to
uncertain environmental threats like air pollution. We study two
cross-randomized interventions in Lahore, Pakistan: 1) general training
in forecasting; 2) provision of air pollution forecasts. Both reduced
subjects’ own air pollution forecast errors; the training effect
suggests that modest educational interventions can durably improve
forecasting skills. Forecast receipt increased demand for protective
masks and the responsiveness of outdoor time to pollution. Forecast
recipients were willing to pay 41 percent of their total mobile phone
costs for continued access, consistent with welfare gains from
adaptation.

<h3><strong>Forecasts: Consumption, Production, and Behavioral
Responses</strong></h3>
<p>(with Husnain A. Fateh, Matthew Gibson, Fatiq Nadeem, and Arman

<p>[Preliminary draft available on request]</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Economic theory predicts forecasts are an
important determinant of welfare. In developing countries, however,
limited information and human capital may make it difficult for agents
to produce accurate, precise forecasts. This plausibly limits the scope
for optimal responses to uncertain future events. Focusing on air
pollution, we explore how urban residents in the developing world solve
forecasting problems in the presence of constraints on information and
human capital. We implement a randomized controlled trial in Lahore,
Pakistan to study the effects on forecast consumption, production, and
behavioral responses from two randomized interventions in Lahore,
Pakistan: 1) provision of one-day ahead air pollution forecasts; and 2)
general forecasting training aimed at reducing behavioral biases. On
average, subjects exposed to forecasts are willing to pay roughly 60
percent of the cost of mobile internet access to continue receiving
them. Both interventions reduce air pollution forecast error, and
receipt of forecasts increase demand for protective masks. These results
document substantial demand for forecasts among urban residents in the
developing world. They suggest that modest educational interventions may
durably improve forecasting-relevant human capital.</p>

<h3><strong>Political Identity and Foreign Aid Efficacy: Evidence from

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We conduct a field experiment to study
whether concerns to preserve an anti-liberal self-image affect low cost,
private school owners’ willingness to explore a collaboration with a
liberal Pakistani NGO. While explicitly revealing the NGO’s liberal
motivation to school owners has a significant impact on beliefs about
the NGO’s objectives, on average, we find only limited evidence that
treated school owners are less willing to explore a collaboration with
our partner NGO. However, heterogeneous treatment effects suggest that
differences in political identity cause negative reactions among the
minority of school owners expressing conservative beliefs during a
seemingly unrelated follow-up survey.</p>

href="https://www.theigc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Habib-March-2021-Final-report.pdf">available</a>
as IGC Research Project Report E-21019-PAK-1, London: International
Growth Center, March 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Air quality in lower and lower-middle
income countries has considerably deteriorated over the past many years,
affecting human capital and welfare. Even though many developing
countries have strong air pollution rules and regulations on paper—with
a comprehensive set of ambient air quality and emission standards—their
air quality outcomes continue to stagnate. Why? We deconstruct this
problem using Pakistan—a developing country with a rich history of
environmental regulation but acute air pollution—as a case study,
demonstrating that regulatory deficiencies, resource and capacity
constraints, and imperfect information prevent environmental
institutions from achieving their objectives. Poorly designed
standards—governed by a command-and-control approach—paltry budgets, and
missing data on source emissions and ambient air quality inhibit
environmental institutions’ ability to monitor and enforce air quality
regulations. Understanding how much citizens value better air quality
(willingness to pay), employing source apportionment studies, and
harnessing the “informal regulator” (civil society) offer opportunities
to fill policy gaps and improve compliance.</p>

<h3><strong>Does conservation messaging reduce urban water

<p>(with Agha Ali Akram and Syed M. Hasan)</p>
<p><em>Supported by the United Nations Development Programme with funds
totaling $40,000</em></p>
<p>[Preliminary draft available on request]</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cities in developing countries often lack
water meters to gauge volumetric consumption, which inhibits water
utilities’ capacity to price the resource. Given the difficulty of
establishing volumetric pricing schemes in unmetered settings, do
informational nudges provide water utilities an effective alternative to
incentivize households to reduce their water consumption? To answer this
question, we conduct a randomized controlled trial in Islamabad,
Pakistan. Our treatment includes three different intervention materials:
an infographics poster depicting water conservation tips; a calendar
with a religious message on water conservation (religious calendar); and
a calendar with a message on potential financial loss due to water
scarcity (loss aversion calendar). We find that the intervention
material pushes the willingness to conserve in the right direction for
most respondents in our treatment arms. Our results suggest that
informational messages offer policymakers a low-cost alternative to
nudge urban households to conserve water in their homes.</p>
