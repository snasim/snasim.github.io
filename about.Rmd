Welcome!

I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics at [Colby College](https://www.colby.edu).

My research interests lie in environment and political economy. I study: 1) citizensâ€™ behavior in response to deteriorating environmental quality (air pollution, groundwater depletion, climate change) in developing countries; and 2) state capacity in developing countries and how it relates to provision of public goods.

I serve as a research fellow at the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives ([IDEAS](https://ideaspak.org)), the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan ([CERP](https://www.cerp.org.pk)), and the Mahbub ul Haq Research Centre ([MHRC](https://mhrc.lums.edu.pk)).

Before joining Colby, I was an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences ([LUMS](https://www.colby.edu)) in Pakistan. I hold a Ph.D. in Environmental and Natural Resource Economics and Policy from the University of California, Riverside (2015) and a B.A. from Colby College (2008).
